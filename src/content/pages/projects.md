[Tallyo](https://github.com/AlexGaudon/tallyo) – My take on a personal finance tracker, since [Mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuit_Mint#Shut_down) ran out of money.

[overs.sh](https://github.com/AlexGaudon/overs.sh) – Super simple file transfer between servers over SSH. Dead easy.

[misery.systems](https://misery.systems) – Where I mess around with my homelab (yeah, it's really called "misery.systems").

[stocky](https://github.com/AlexGaudon/stocky) – A Discord bot that spits out stock prices on command.

[ntfy-bridge](https://github.com/alexgaudon/ntfy-bridge) – Bridges Discord and [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) so you can get notifications wherever you want.
